# Preparation
This exercise focuses on building an **Airline Management System** using **SAP CAP**, covering data modeling, business rule implementation, and service development. You will create a `schema.cds` file to define entities like passengers, flights, and reservations, load initial data via `.csv` files, and implement REST services with validations. If you encounter any issues, ask for assistance to ensure a smooth experience throughout the session.

   - **Node.js** (LTS version).  
   - **SAP CAP CLI** installed via `npm install -g @sap/cds`.
